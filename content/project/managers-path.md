## Introduction

Software engineering management is a multifaceted role that involves both leading a team while also steering technical decisions. "The Manager's Path" is the canonical book  in this field, guiding readers from the basics of management to the intricacies of executive leadership roles such as VP or CTO.

> "What engineering managers do, though, is not pure people management. We are managing groups of technical people, and most of us come into the role from a position of hands-on expertise. I wouldn't recommend trying to do it any other way!"

### Management 101

> "Friends of mine talk about their best managers as managing them with "benign neglect".

Everyone's first management experience is actually being managed. I think if someone is interested in becoming a manager, it's important to seek out good managers - if this is not possible, at least observe different styles of management.

#### 1-on-1s
One of the most important aspects of management is establishing a regular cadence of 1-on-1s. These should establish a safe and trusting environment that allows for human connection while also creating a platform to discuss the direct report's career aspirations and goals. Manager's should listen actively and empathetically, while direct reports should take responsibility for their career direction and/or come prepared to discuss what they'd like to talk about.

- Typically these are not status meetings, although I've found they can be if the report encounters a lot of blockers. Status can be updated in other avenues (slack, email)
- Offer both praise and constructive criticism - focusing on specific examples and actionable suggestions
    - Typically praise can be public, while criticism should be reserved for private communications. I've found that you can typically ask direct reports how they like to receive feedback. Some people like an async message before the 1-on-1, others prefer to just hear all feedback in person.
  - A good manager lets reports know when they screw up - the sooner a report knows about bad habits, the easier it will be to correct. Feedback should be timely (as close to the observed action/behavior as possible), be given in the form of specific examples, and depersonalized (focused on specific actions/decisions/outcomes rather than attacking any person)


> "Regular 1-1s are like oil changes; if you skip them, plan to get stranded on the side of the highway at the worst possible time."


### Mentoring

Mentoring is a great opportunity for anyone interested in management because it provides a safe way to get the feel for the job of management, and the feeling of being responsible for another person.

Several of the same principles as a manager/direct report relationship carry over to mentorship:
- a good mentor should actively listen and communicate clearly. It's helpful if communication is done in the style of the mentee (listen and speak their language)
- a good mentee comes prepared with what they're interested in learning
- New hiring/onboarding is a great time to setup a mentor/mentee relationship


A successful mentorship might include the mentor going to their network and telling how great the company they're working for is.


## Chapter 2: Tech Lead

>"A tech lead is not a point in the career ladder, but rather a set of responsibilities than an engineer may take once they reach the senior level. This role may or may not include people management, but if it does, the tech lead is expected to manage these team members to high management standards..."

 The role may also not be the most senior on the team, it just happens to more heavily involved in **project management** and being able to delegate work effectively without micromanaging. A tech lead shifts from worrying about their own productivity, to focusing more on the whole team's **productivity**


Much of the tech lead role is about learning to balance technical commitments with work the whole team needs (project management, helping unblock teammates, and in general things that a software engineer up until this point doesn't have as much experience with and may feel less comfortable working on). If as an IC, the SWE was spending almost 100% time spent coding, when they transition to tech lead they might expect to code  around 30% of the time.

There are a few different roles as a tech lead:

- <u>System architect / business analyst </u> - have a good understanding of the overal architecture and understanding of how to design complex software
- <u>Project planner</u> - break down work into rough deliverables - getting as much productive work ready in parallel as possible. There's a certain dogged persistence that a project planner must carry in order to "push through the unknown" and discover what the work requires, until there's no more value to be gained from spending discovery time. A project planner also might track the project and course correct, use insights gained in the planning process to manage requirement changes, and run a pre and postmortem
- <u>Software developer/Team leader</u> - this is the part of the role that still writes code. You'll delegate a lot of work as a tech lead, but you should still write and stay up to date with the code


A few tips to be a good tech lead:
- Understand the architecture - impossible to lead projects when you don't understand the architecture you're changing
- Be a team player - a tech lead shoudl stop themselves if they're doing all the interesting work. Working on the boring/frustrating parts of the code base can teach you a lot about where the process is broken.
- Lead technical decisions - have a good sense of decisions that you must make versus what you should delegate to others with more expertise
- Communicate - Instead of every team member sitting in technical meetings, you're representing them as tech lead - bring info from those meetings back to the team.
