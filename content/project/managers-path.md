## Introduction

Software engineering management is a multifaceted role that involves both leading a team while also steering technical decisions. "The Manager's Path" is the canonical book  in this field, guiding readers from the basics of management to the intricacies of executive leadership roles such as VP or CTO.

> "What engineering managers do, though, is not pure people management. We are managing groups of technical people, and most of us come into the role from a position of hands-on expertise. I wouldn't recommend trying to do it any other way!"

### Management 101

> "Friends of mine talk about their best managers as managing them with "benign neglect".

Everyone's first management experience is actually being managed. I think if someone is interested in becoming a manager, it's important to seek out good managers - if this is not possible, at least observe different styles of management.

#### 1-on-1s
One of the most important aspects of management is establishing a regular cadence of 1-on-1s in which direct reports. These should establish a safe and trusting environment that allows for human connection while also creating a platform to discuss the direct report's career aspirations and goals. Manager's should listen actively and empathetically, while direct reports should take responsibility for their career direction abd/or come prepared to discuss what they'd like to talk about.

- Typically these are not status meetings, although I've found they can be - you can get updated status in other avenues (slack, email)
- Offer both praise and constructive criticism - focusing on specific examples and actionable suggestions
    - Typically praise can be public, while criticism should be reserved for private communications. I've found that you can typically ask direct reports how they like to receive feedback. Some people like an async message before the 1-on-1, others prefer to just hear all feedback in person.
  - A good manager lets reports know when they screw up - the sooner a report knows about bad habits, the easier it will be to correct. Feedback should be timely (as close to the observed action/behavior as possible), be given in the form of specific examples, and depersonalized (focused on specific actions/decisions/outcomes rather than attacking any person)


> "Regular 1-1s are like oil changes; if you skip them, plan to get stranded on the side of the highway at the worst possible time."
