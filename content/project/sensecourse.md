## Intro

_SenseCourse_ is an application that a student teammate and I built for the [Education Technology](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6460-educational-technology) class in OMSCS. The Education Technology course was a broad look into the intersection of education and technology including: pedagogical models, current technology issues, and understading the field through various EdTech research papers and past final projects.

While going through several EdTech research papers, I was intrigued by the topic of _sentiment analysis and opinion mining_. A few papers illustarted how well machine learning techniques could generate insights - they could offer feedback to professors (or students) based on student's written assignments. This automated feedback often gave professors a chance to adjust their teaching style to match student learning styles.

This ultimately led to us choosing SenseCourse - an application that helped students choose a particular set of of OMSCS classes (specialization). Fortunately, the OMSCS program had collected hundreds of reviews for each course from former students. The idea was to generate a collective sentiment analysis for each course based on reviews, and match that with the sentiment analysis provided by a SenseCourse user from a few input prompts.
