The GitHub browser is a simple single page app built in Angular that lets users search and visualize a breakdown of repositories for a given user. The idea was to explore developing single page apps in combination with a data-rich API like GitHub. What makes the idea of creating a browser useful is the fact that repos usually have more than one contributor - so browsing to different user's repos was a breeze to setup.
