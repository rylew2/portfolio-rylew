[Smile Communications](https://smile.com.ng/) is one of Africa’s largest 4G LTE provider. Launched in 2007, Smile currently provides fast and reliable Internet and Voice Services for 4 countries in Africa; Tanzania, Nigeria, The Republic of Congo and Uganda.

Smile’s [objective](https://smilecoms.com/about-us/) is to become the broadband provider of choice for SuperFast data and SuperClear voice as well as provide 300 million potential customers with fast, reliable and high-quality Internet Services.

## Project Scope.

The Smile brand consists of offline and online touchpoints; A few offline shops scattered across the continent and an online dashboard that lets users manage their accounts.

> My focus was to evaluate and improve the online account management experience.

**NB**: This is an unsolicited design. Meaning it is a side project and in no way related to the official Smile Communications.

### Why The Redesign?

I’m not usually a fan of unsolicited redesigns, but while I was thinking of a side project to kick off the year with, Smile’s website was the only annoying thing on my mind.

The site is totally unresponsive, I’ve been a Smile customer for about 2years but I feel like every time’s my first. The curiosity kicked in.

> Are other users finding the site annoying too? What might I learn from making the Smile experience “less annoying”? (Hopefully)

### Design Process
