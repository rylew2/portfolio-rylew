## Intro

In the technology industry, software engineers typically reach the Senior level, considered the career level, within five to eight years. At this stage, further promotions are not mandatory and are more of an exception than an expectation. This is also the point where engineers often have the option to transition into engineering management ([<u>see Manager's Path</u>](/books/managerspath)).

However, for those who wish to advance their careers without shifting to engineering management, many companies offer a two-track career path. The first track is engineering management, while the second is technical leadership, with roles like Staff Engineer and Principal Engineer.

The book explores the staff-plus engineer roles at various companies and noticed four distinct patterns or archetypes emerged.

In order to understand which role is right for you - you have to stay engaged and know what kind of work energizes you. A tech lead or architect might work with the same people or problems for years, developing a tight sense of team and shared purpose. A solver or right hand type might bounce from fire to fire, only having transactional interactions with folks they're working with each week.
