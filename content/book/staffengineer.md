## Intro

In the technology industry, software engineers typically reach the Senior level, considered the career level, within five to eight years. At this stage, further promotions are not mandatory and are more of an exception than an expectation. This is also the point where engineers often have the option to transition into engineering management ([<u>see Manager's Path</u>](/books/managerspath)).

However, for those who wish to advance their careers without shifting to engineering management, many companies offer a two-track career path. The first track is engineering management, while the second is technical leadership, with roles like Staff Engineer and Principal Engineer.

The book explores the staff-plus engineer roles at various companies and noticed four distinct patterns or archetypes emerged.

In order to understand which role is right for you - you have to stay engaged and know what kind of work energizes you. A tech lead or architect might work with the same people or problems for years, developing a tight sense of team and shared purpose. A solver or right hand type might bounce from fire to fire, only having transactional interactions with folks they're working with each week.

## What do Staff Engineers actually do

> "The role of a Staff-plus engineer depends a lot on what the team needs and also what the particular engineer's strengths are. ... usually their main focus is working on projects/efforts that have strategic value for the company while driving technical design and up-leveling their team." - Diana Pojar

There's a shared set of tasks that all archetypes will participate in - setting/editing technical direction, providing sponsorship and mentorship, injecting engineering context into org decisions, and being glue:

-   **Setting Technical Direction**:

    -   Serve as a part-time product manager with a focus on technology.
    -   Prioritize the real technological needs of the organization over personal interests in specific technologies.

-   **Mentorship and Sponsorship**:

    -   Influence the company's long-term growth by nurturing other engineers.
    -   Engage more in sponsorship than mentorship to maximize influence and support.

-   **Providing Engineering Perspective**:

    -   Offer valuable insights during critical, time-sensitive decision-making processes.
    -   Ensure that an engineering viewpoint is considered in important organizational decisions.

-   **Exploration**:

    -   Handle ambiguous, significant issues that fall outside the company's current systems.
    -   Build organizational trust to be tasked with exploration, accepting the risks of potential failure.

-   **Being Glue** (see Tanya Reilly's <u><a href="https://noidea.dog/glue" target="_blank">Being Glue</a></u>):

    -   Undertake essential yet often unnoticed tasks to maintain team momentum and successful project delivery.
    -   Recognize the shift from frequent coding to facilitating broader project goals and team needs.
    -   This is an expected task when you're senior, but doing it too early can push people out of engineering

-   **Coding and Contributions**:

    -   Expect reduced time spent on direct software development compared to earlier career stages.
    -   Recognize frequent coding as a comfort zone indicator and a sign of potentially misplaced focus.

-   **Pace and Feedback**:
    -   Adapt to a slower feedback loop that extends over weeks, months, or even years, rather than immediate results.

## Does the title even matter

If you're a senior engineer is it even worth it to invest time to become a staff engineer? It turns out there are some advantages to pursuing a staff-plus role:

-   **Informal gauges of seniority** - Don't need to prove yourself as much, allowing you to focus on the core work
-   **Being in the room** - able to provide input before implementation (when it's cheap to do so)
-   **Compensation** - different than a senior engineer
-   **Access to interesting work** - While the role can sometimes grant access to interesting work, a staff engineer can't just pursue interesting work out of personal interest as they should put the team or business first

## Working on what matters

As individuals progress in their careers, the challenge becomes navigating the increasing expectations against the backdrop of a fulfilling life filled with family, hobbies, and personal growth. The essence of sustaining a long and successful career lies in pacing oneself, ensuring that as responsibilities grow, one doesn't sacrifice personal well-being for professional achievements. It's about consciously avoiding the pitfalls of busyness over productivity, vanity metrics over substance, and unattainable goals over realistic ones, focusing instead on work that truly matters both personally and to the organization.

        <td>Engaging in tasks that are easy and low-impact, offering a false sense of accomplishment.</td>
        <td>Regularly evaluate the impact of your tasks and focus on those that align with organizational priorities.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Preening</strong></td>
        <td>Performing low-impact, high-visibility work, which can be misconstrued as impactful due to its visibility.</td>
        <td>Seek out work that not only has visibility but also significantly contributes to the company's goals.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Chasing Ghosts</strong></td>
        <td>Pursuing high-effort, low-impact projects that may stem from a misunderstanding of company challenges.</td>
        <td>Invest time in understanding the company's core challenges and resist the urge to initiate changes without thorough analysis.</td>

## Writing Engineering Strategy

> "I kind of think writing about engineering strategy is hard because good strategy is pretty boring, and it’s kind of boring to write about. Also I think when people hear “strategy” they think “innovation” " - Camille Fournier

Your company may call them RFCs or tech specs. A good design doc describes a specific problem, surveys possible solutions, and explains the selected approach's details. Design docs should be grounded in specifics to prevent multiple different interpretations by engineers.

Writing an effective engineering strategy involves creating mundane yet essential documents that guide decision-making and align teams. The process of developing a strategy is straightforward and more effective than many realize. The book offers a few recommendations:

-   **Identify and Clarify the Problem** - Begin with a clear statement of the problem, as it sets the stage for finding effective solutions. If solutions aren't clear, spend more time refining your understanding of the problem. When stuck, consult with others for fresh perspectives.
-   **Simplify the Design Document Template** - Utilize the existing design document template of your company as a foundation. Avoid making the template overly complex, as this can deter people from writing design documents. Aim for a minimal template that highlights the most crucial sections, particularly for projects with significant risks.
-   **Collaborative Input, Individual Writing** - Acknowledge that having all the relevant information to write the best design document is unlikely. Seek input from various stakeholders early in the process, but be cautious about turning this collaboration into a group writing effort. While it's important to incorporate a wide range of views, the actual writing should be a solo endeavor to ensure clarity.
-   **Aim for Quality, Not Perfection** - Focus on writing a good and substantial document rather than waiting to achieve perfection. When providing feedback on others' designs, avoid the expectation that their work should match your highest standards. Especially in senior roles, encourage the production of quality work, rather than insisting on perfection in every design.

### Synthesize the design docs into a strategy

After gathering five design docs, look for controversial decisions that came up in multiple designs (particularly those that were hard to agree on). An example from the book is deciding whether Redis is just a cache or if it's appropriate to use as durable storage. The idea is to reflect on how these decisions were made and wrote them down as a strategy.

-   **Analyze and Synthesize Design Documents** - Review the five design documents collectively. Identify and focus on controversial or difficult decisions that recur in multiple documents. Use these insights to form a cohesive strategy.
-   **Guide Tradeoffs with Clear Rationale** - Effective strategies should guide decision-making tradeoffs and clearly explain the underlying rationale. Avoid strategies that state policies without context, as they quickly become irrelevant and difficult to adapt.
-   **Be Specific and Opinionated** - Emphasize specifics in your strategy, avoiding generalizations. Strategies should be opinionated, providing clear guidance on decision-making, and must demonstrate the thought process behind these opinions.
-   **Show Your Work** - Like solving a math problem, showing your work in strategy development is crucial. This approach not only builds confidence in the strategy but also allows others to understand and adapt it as contexts change.

### Combining Strategies into a Vision

Creating a compelling engineering vision from multiple strategies involves weaving together different approaches into a cohesive plan for the next two to three years. The final version should give you what Tanya Reilly calls ["a robust belief in the future](https://leaddev.com/technical-direction-strategy/sending-gifts-future-you) - the result should be a common thread among existing strategies as well as making it easier to write additional strategies that stand the test of time. Here's a few tips for writing a vision:

-   **Combine Strategies Thoughtfully** - Analyze and harmonize different strategies, even if they seem contradictory.
-   **Focus on a 2-3 Year Horizon** - Develop a vision that is realistic for a rapidly changing technological and business landscape.
-   **Align with Business and User Needs** - Ensure the vision serves users and aligns with leadership's core values. (Bad visions might focus on technical sophistication for the sake of being complex, which can become disconnected from benefiting customers and leadership values. IE.. a vision propsing latest AI technology because its innovative, withotu showing how it drives busienss growth)
-   **Be Ambitious but Realistic** - Aim for the best possible outcomes within resource constraints. (You're not writing a vision with the assumption of infinite resources)
-   **Detail Matters** - Provide concrete details and avoid vague statements to guide strategy effectively.
-   **Keep It Concise** - Limit the vision to 1-2 pages and link to more in-depth documents for interested readers. (Most people won't read longer than a page)
-   **Share and Refine** - Share across the organization and measure success by the improvement in strategies and design documents over time.
